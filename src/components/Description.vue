        <p>Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.</p><p>There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:</p><p>Using <code>//</code> will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line:</p><p><pre><code class="language-js">// This is an in-line comment.</code></pre></p><p>You can make a multi-line comment beginning with <code>/*</code> and ending with <code>*/</code>:</p><p><pre><code class="language-js">/* This is amulti-line comment */</code></pre></p><p><strong>Best Practice</strong><br>As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code. Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your codeâ€”both for others <em>and</em> for your future self.</p>
